Building a command line Hangman game that will utilize files to save and reload games.

Finished building the command line Hangman game. 

Building out the game was pretty straight forward, I did encounter challenges when trying to build a function that allowed the user to save his current game at the start of every turn. 

I also added functionality to allow the user to load a previous game when the program first loads up.

This was my first time coding with serialization and YAML and I'm excited to keep using it!
